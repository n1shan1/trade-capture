/**
 * Represents a pending message from RabbitMQ Stream that has been received
 * but not yet persisted to the database or had its offset committed.
 * 
 * This class pairs a trade event with its stream offset to enable proper
 * crash recovery semantics:
 * - Offset is committed ONLY after successful DB persistence
 * - If crash occurs before commit, stream will replay from last committed offset
 * - This guarantees at-least-once delivery without data loss
